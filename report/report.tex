\section{Introduction and theory}
Along with updrafts, downdrafts---downward-moving masses of air---are
important features in the dynamics of the Earth's atmosphere;
they transport mass, momentum, heat and moisture vertically
and also generate and maintain storms \parencite{knupp_cotton_1985}.

Indeed, one of the main objectives of present-day research into
downdraft dynamics is to improve the predictions of global climate
models \parencite{thayer-calder_2013}, whose output informs the
understanding of the larger-scale
dynamics, including the pressing issue of anthropogenic climate
change. Specifically, the high computational cost of running a global
climate model over the necessarily large spatial domain and prediction
timescales constrains their maximum resolution, which is still too
coarse to describe convection. The models therefore employ schemes
known as \emph{parametrisations} which estimate the effect of
convection on the state of the model using the information available
at each time step; an accurate estimation requires a strong
understanding of the factors that govern convection.

On a smaller scale, strong downdrafts that reach the Earth's surface
(\emph{downbursts}) are known to cause significant damage to
man-made structures and create hazardous, or even deadly, conditions
for aircraft \parencite{thayer-calder_2013}. Another aim of downdraft
research is therefore to understand the mechanisms that generate
such extreme events and improve the ability to predict them in advance.

Considering these motivations, the goal of this work is to gain
insight into which processes and conditions initiate, and which
maintain or inhibit, downdrafts. The approach will be to construct
a significantly simplified model of a downdraft using \emph{parcel
theory}.

An air parcel is a mass of air with an imaginary flexible (but usually
closed) boundary; under the usual assumptions, its exact size and
shape are irrelevant. The only force assumed to act on the parcel is
the net buoyant force (per unit mass), given in accordance with
Archimedes' principle by
\begin{equation}
	b = \frac{\rho_E - \rho_P}{\rho_P} g.
	\label{eqn:buoyancy}
\end{equation}
If the parcel is lowered in the atmosphere to a location with a higher
pressure, the work done to compress it and any heat exchanged will
manifest as a change in its internal energy in accordance with the
first law of thermodynamics. The second key assumption of parcel theory
is that this process is adiabatic; this is valid due to the low
thermal conductivity of air.

The potential presence of water in gas, liquid and solid phases in the
parcel is a major complication; under the assumption that the parcel
remains in phase equilibrium (i.e., changes are slow enough for
excess liquid to evaporate if the vapour pressure is below the
saturation value), there are two modes of adiabatic descent the parcel
may undergo. If no liquid is present, the descent is \emph{dry
adiabatic} and the rate of work on the parcel causes it to warm at
an approximate rate of $\SI{9.8}{\kelvin \per\kilo\meter}$.
If liquid is present, the descent is \emph{moist adiabatic}:
progressive warming of the parcel raises its saturation vapour pressure,
allowing the liquid to progressively evaporate during descent,
with the necessary transfer of latent heat from the air to the water
creating an opposing cooling effect.

Moist adiabatic descent is commonly assumed to be either
\emph{pseudoadiabatic}, in which case liquid water does not contribute
to the heat capacity of the parcel (as if it precipitates from the
parcel immediately upon condensation), or \emph{reversible}, in
which case the liquid does contribute to the heat capacity.
A reversibly descending parcel warms at a slightly slower rate than a
pseudoadiabatically descending one due to its larger heat capacity
\textcite{saunders_1957}.
Both modes were investigated, but reversible descent was ultimately
chosen as it is the more realistic case for a parcel known to retain
liquid water.

If the pressure and temperature of the parcel are thus known at any
point in its descent, its density may be calculated using the ideal
gas law,
\begin{equation}
	\rho = \frac{p}{RT_v}, \label{eqn:density}
\end{equation}
where $T_v$ is the \emph{virtual temperature} that contains a small
correction to account for the different density of water vapour.
If an mass $l$ of liquid water, per unit total parcel mass, is also
present, it is easily shown that (assuming the liquid occupies
negligible volume) the corrected parcel density is
\begin{equation}
	\rho = \frac{p}{RT_v (1 - l)}.
\end{equation}
Knowledge of the parcel and environmental densities enable calculation
of the buoyant force per unit mass on the parcel using
(\ref{eqn:buoyancy}), and its resulting displacement and velocity may be
obtained by (numerically) solving the ODE
\begin{equation}
	\frac{\mathrm{d}^2 z}{\mathrm{d}t^2} = b(z).
\end{equation}

% \subsection{Downdraft dynamics}
In their review of existing literature,
\textcite{knupp_cotton_1985} identify four downdraft types based
on the mechanisms that generate or maintain them, which
informed the methods of this investigation: penetrative, cloud-edge,
overshooting and precipitation-associated.
The penetrative type arises when subsaturated environmental air
is \emph{entrained} (mixed) into saturated cloudy air, allowing
evaporation of the excess liquid that creates negative buoyancy.
The cloud-edge type, they note, is less understood and may result
from evaporative cooling at the edges of clouds.
An overshooting downdraft may be generated when the inertia of
an updraft causes it to rise beyond its level of neutral buoyancy
and subsequently sink.
The precipitation-associated downdraft is generated by the evaporation
of precipitation into subsaturated air beneath a cloud, with the cooling
creating negative buoyancy. They note that $\SI{20}{\meter \per\second}$
is a typical upper limit on downdraft velocity in all cases. The model
presented in
this work most closely describes the precipitation-assiciated and
penetrative types.

\textcite{knupp_cotton_1985} find that downdrafts often become
subsaturated during descent, a conclusion reproduced by
\textcite{thayer-calder_2013} in a Lagrangian (parcel-tracking)
study of the output of a cloud-resolving model. The latter also found
that downdrafts often descend past their neutral buoyancy levels.
These findings are clearly reproduced in this work.

\textcite{market_2017} use case studies to investigate the dependence
of downdraft
penetration depth on quantities known as \emph{downdraft convective
available potential energy} (DCAPE) and \emph{downdraft convective
inhibition} (DCIN). The former is a measure of the maximum kinetic
energy per unit mass a parcel in a given environment may gain,
and the latter is a measure of the work necessary to bring the parcel
to the ground once it passes its neutral buoyancy level, against
the upward buoyant force. Both are calculated as integrals of the
buoyant force with respect to height between chosen initial and final
levels (bracketing
regions of positive buoyancy for DCAPE and negative buoyancy for DCIN).
They come to the conclusion that the smaller
the DCIN relative to the DCAPE, the more likely downdrafts are to
penetrate stable parts of the atmosphere and reach the ground.
\textcite{sumrall_2020} conducts further case study investigations,
with findings supporting a hypothesis that small ratios of
$|\dcin/\dcape|$ are correlated with stronger and deeper downdraft
activity and surface winds, and vice versa for large ratios.
This work also reproduces the above findings.

% \subsection{Thermodynamic calculations}


\section{Methods}
% OUTLINE
% 	- Additional assumptions
% 	- Code structure
\subsection{General approach and code structure}
All calculations were performed in Python 3.8.5. Other than
basic thermodynamic calculations (such as saturation specific humidity
from pressure and temperature, and density according to
(\ref{eqn:density})) which were imported from the open-source
\verb|MetPy| package \parencite{metpy}, the model was built from
scratch and from first principles. The model is divided between
three scripts, whose functions are described below.

\verb|environment.py| defines the \verb|Environment| class, which
provides utilities for finding the various environmental variables
at any height, allowing the model to be applicable to any real or
idealised atmospheric \emph{sounding} (vertical profile of environmental
variables). The class is instantiated by supplying discrete vertical
profiles of pressure, temperature and dewpoint, and the resulting
instance offers methods that interpolate the data and calculate
derived quantities at any height. For example, the density at
$\SI{5}{\kilo\meter}$ in an \verb|Environment| named \verb|sydney|,
initialised with a measured sounding over Sydney, is given by
\verb|sydney.density(5*units.kilometer)|.

\verb|thermo.py| provides various thermodynamic calculations that
are not available in \verb|MetPy|. The following important functions are
implementations of existing published methods:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \emph{Equivalent potential temperature} (a variable with
		dimensions of temperature that is conserved during moist
		adiabatic descent) as a function of pressure,
		temperature and specific humidity, following the empirical
		formula presented by \textcite{bolton_1980} in his Equation
		(39),
	\item DCAPE and DCIN for a given atmospheric sounding, following
		the definitions of \textcite{market_2017},
	\item The exact analytical solution for the \emph{lifting
		condensation level} (LCL), the pressure level to which a parcel must
		be lifted in order to cool it to the point of saturation and
		the temperature at this point, adapting the implementation
		of \textcite{romps_2017},
	\item The \emph{wet bulb temperature} (the temperature to which
		a parcel is cooled by evaporation of water to the point of
		saturation, at constant pressure), using Normand's rule.
		Normand's rule states that if a parcel is lifted dry
		adiabaically to its LCL (which we find using the method of
		\textcite{romps_2017}) and lowered moist adiabatically back
		to the initial level, it attains its wet bulb temperature.
	\item An approximate, but faster, wet bulb temperature calculation
		implementing the method of \textcite{davies-jones_2008}, and
	\item The parcel temperature resulting from reversible adiabatic
		ascent or descent, implementing a numerical solution of
		Equation (3) presented by \textcite{saunders_1957}.
\end{itemize}
Additional original functions written for the model are described
in the subsections that follow.

\verb|entraining_parcel.py| defines the \verb|EntrainingParcel| class,
which assembles the functions of the other two scripts to create
the final model. It is instantiated by supplying an \verb|Environment|
instance and offers methods for calculating parcel displacement
and velocity as functions of time, given some initial conditions,
on that atmospheric sounding. These are described in detail in
the following subsections.
